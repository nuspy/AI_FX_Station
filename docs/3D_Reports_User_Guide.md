## üéØ Available Report Types

### 1. 3D Market Surface üìà

**What it shows**: Price movements across multiple currency pairs over time in a 3D landscape

#### How to Read:
- **X-Axis (Time)**: Hours or days (newest on right)
- **Y-Axis (Pairs)**: Different currency pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD, etc.)
- **Z-Axis (Price)**: Price levels (higher = more expensive)
- **Colors**: Price intensity (green = high, red = low)

#### Key Insights:
- **Synchronized Movements**: Look for parallel "waves" across pairs
- **Divergences**: When one pair moves differently (trading opportunities)
- **Market Regimes**: Smooth surfaces = trending, jagged = volatile
- **Support/Resistance**: Flat areas show key price levels

#### Best Used For:
- **Portfolio Analysis**: See how all your pairs are moving together
- **Trend Identification**: Spot market-wide trends vs. pair-specific moves
- **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Find pairs that haven't caught up to overall movement

### 2. Correlation Sphere üåê

**What it shows**: Currency relationships visualized on an interactive 3D sphere

#### How to Read:
- **Points on Sphere**: Each dot represents a currency pair
- **Red Lines**: Positive correlation (pairs move together)
- **Blue Lines**: Negative correlation (pairs move opposite)
- **Line Thickness**: Strength of correlation (thicker = stronger)
- **No Lines**: Weak/no correlation

#### Key Insights:
- **Portfolio Diversification**: Avoid clustering too many correlated pairs
- **Hedging Opportunities**: Use negatively correlated pairs to hedge risk
- **Market Relationships**: Understand which currencies move together
- **Risk Assessment**: High correlation = higher portfolio risk

#### Best Used For:
- **Building Balanced Portfolios**: Ensure proper diversification
- **Pairs Trading**: Find strongly negatively correlated pairs
- **Risk Management**: Assess overall portfolio correlation risk

### 3. Volatility Landscape ‚õ∞Ô∏è

**What it shows**: Market volatility patterns as a 3D terrain map

#### How to Read:
- **Peaks**: High volatility periods (dangerous/opportunity)
- **Valleys**: Low volatility periods (calm markets)
- **Red Areas**: Extreme volatility (high risk)
- **Blue Areas**: Calm periods (low risk)
- **Contour Lines**: Volatility levels (like topographical maps)

#### Key Insights:
- **Risk Periods**: Avoid trading during extreme volatility peaks
- **Opportunity Windows**: Low volatility often precedes big moves
- **Event Detection**: Sudden peaks indicate news/economic events
- **Volatility Clustering**: High volatility periods tend to cluster

#### Best Used For:
- **Position Sizing**: Reduce size during high volatility
- **Entry Timing**: Enter positions during calm periods
- **Risk Management**: Prepare for volatility clusters
- **Event Analysis**: Identify market-moving events

### 4. Correlation Heat Map üî•

**What it shows**: Pairwise correlations in a color-coded matrix

#### How to Read:
- **Red**: Strong positive correlation (+0.7 to +1.0)
- **Blue**: Strong negative correlation (-0.7 to -1.0)
- **White**: No correlation (near 0)
- **Numbers**: Exact correlation coefficients
- **Diagonal**: Always 1.0 (pairs correlate perfectly with themselves)

#### Key Insights:
- **Quick Overview**: Instant visual of all pair relationships
- **Clustering**: Groups of red squares show related currencies
- **Diversification Gaps**: Blue areas show good hedge opportunities
- **Strength Assessment**: Darker colors = stronger relationships

#### Best Used For:
- **Quick Reference**: Fast correlation check before trading
- **Portfolio Review**: Assess current portfolio correlation
- **Educational**: Learn which currencies typically move together

## üìö Practical Examples

### Example 1: Building a Diversified Portfolio

**Goal**: Create a balanced 4-pair portfolio

**Steps**:
1. Generate **Correlation Sphere** report
2. Look for pairs with **thin or no connecting lines**
3. Avoid clusters of red lines (high correlation)
4. Select pairs from different "regions" of the sphere
5. Generate **Heat Map** to confirm low correlation numbers

**Expected Result**: Portfolio with correlations below 0.5 between pairs

### Example 2: Timing Market Entry

**Goal**: Find the best time to enter a position

**Steps**:
1. Generate **Volatility Landscape** report
2. Identify current market position (latest time period)
3. Look for **valley (low volatility)** in your chosen pair
4. Check **3D Market Surface** for trend direction
5. Enter position during calm period in trend direction

**Expected Result**: Better entry timing with lower risk

### Example 3: Risk Assessment

**Goal**: Assess portfolio risk before weekend

**Steps**:
1. Generate **3D Market Surface** for trend analysis
2. Generate **Volatility Landscape** for risk assessment
3. Check for **rising volatility peaks** approaching
4. Review **Correlation Sphere** for risk concentration
5. Consider reducing positions if high risk detected
