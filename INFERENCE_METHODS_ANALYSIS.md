# Inference Methods Analysis - UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE ✅

## Current Architecture (UNIFIED)

### Call Flow
```
ForecastWorker.run()
  └─> _parallel_infer() [ALWAYS - unified path]
        ├─> Legacy support: resolve model_path → model_paths[0]
        ├─> get_parallel_engine()
        ├─> run_parallel_inference() [external]
        ├─> Simple replication (models predict for specific horizon)
        └─> Ensemble aggregation (if multiple models)
```

### Architecture Changes (2025-10-02)
**UNIFIED**: All forecasts now use `_parallel_infer()` - single source of truth ✅

This means:
- Single code path for all forecasts (single or multiple models)
- Legacy `model_path` parameter automatically converted to `model_paths`
- `_local_infer()` method DELETED (~650 lines removed)
- Cleaner codebase with no code duplication

## Feature Status (Post-Unification)

### ✅ Features in `_parallel_infer()` (CURRENT UNIFIED METHOD)
1. **Model Loading & Execution**
   - Single or multiple model support
   - Parallel execution with ThreadPoolExecutor
   - External ParallelInferenceEngine coordination

2. **Prediction Processing**
   - Simple replication (NO linear scaling - models predict for specific horizon)
   - Ensemble aggregation with weighted averaging
   - Confidence intervals from prediction variance

3. **Testing Support**
   - `testing_point_ts` for historical testing ✅
   - `anchor_price` from Alt+Click ✅
   - `requested_at_ms` for time anchoring ✅

4. **Performance Tracking**
   - Records predictions with `performance_registry.record_prediction()` ✅
   - Model performance metadata ✅

### ❌ Features REMOVED (were in old `_local_infer()`, now deleted)
1. ❌ Enhanced Multi-Horizon System with `convert_single_to_multi_horizon()`
2. ❌ Regime detection and smart adaptive scaling
3. ❌ Trading scenario support
4. ❌ Volatility-based adjustments
5. ❌ Advanced scaling modes (smart_adaptive, conservative, aggressive)

## Solution Implemented ✅

**OPTION 2: Unify Methods** - COMPLETED

### What Was Done:
1. ✅ Modified `run()` to always call `_parallel_infer()` directly
2. ✅ Added legacy support in `_parallel_infer()` for single `model_path` parameter
3. ✅ Deleted `_local_infer()` method entirely (~650 lines removed)
4. ✅ Fixed linear scaling bug in `parallel_inference.py`
5. ✅ Updated documentation

### Benefits Achieved:
- ✅ Single source of truth for all forecasts
- ✅ No code duplication
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- ✅ Consistent behavior for single and multiple models
- ✅ Reduced file size from 1412 to ~760 lines

### Trade-offs:
- ❌ Enhanced Multi-Horizon System features removed (were in `_local_infer()` only)
- ❌ Regime detection and smart scaling no longer available
- ❌ Trading scenario support removed

**Note**: Enhanced Multi-Horizon features can be re-added to `_parallel_infer()` in future if needed, but are not critical for current functionality since the bug was in linear scaling, not in Enhanced features.

## Code Changes Summary

### `forecast_worker.py`
1. **Lines 98-108**: `run()` now always calls `_parallel_infer()`
2. **Lines 272-922**: `_local_infer()` DELETED
3. **Lines 965-972**: Legacy `model_path` resolution in `_parallel_infer()`

### `parallel_inference.py`
1. **Lines 323-330**: Fixed linear scaling bug (replicate instead of multiply)

### Documentation
1. **INFERENCE_METHODS_ANALYSIS.md**: Updated to reflect unified architecture
2. **FORECAST_ANALYSIS.md**: Already documented the scaling bug fix

## Current Architecture

```python
# Before (2 paths):
run() → _local_infer() → check flag → _parallel_infer() if parallel
                        → local logic if not parallel

# After (1 path):
run() → _parallel_infer() → handles both single and multiple models
                          → legacy model_path support
                          → ParallelInferenceEngine
```
