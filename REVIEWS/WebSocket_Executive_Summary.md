   - No Protobuf message parsing for order book
   - No database writer for DOM snapshots
   - **Impact:** Order Flow Panel shows no real-time data

2. **GUI Data Connection (0%)**
   - `OrderFlowPanel.refresh_display()` is empty (line 374)
   - No connection to DOMAggregatorService
   - No timer-based updates with real data
   - **Impact:** GUI displays placeholder values only

3. **Real-time Volume (0%)**
   - No volume parsing from WebSocket
   - Buy/sell volume split not implemented
   - **Impact:** Volume imbalance metrics unavailable

4. **Twisted→asyncio Bridge (0%)**
   - `_connect_twisted()` is empty placeholder (line 148)
   - Reactor lifecycle management missing
   - **Impact:** WebSocket cannot connect

## 🚨 Critical Findings

### Finding #1: Order Book Data Never Reaches GUI
**Location:** `ctrader_provider.py:466-470`
```python
async def _stream_market_depth_impl(self, symbols: List[str]) -> AsyncIterator[Dict[str, Any]]:
    logger.warning(f"[{self.name}] stream_market_depth not yet implemented")
    yield {}  # ❌ RETURNS EMPTY DICT
```
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical - Blocks all order flow functionality

---

### Finding #2: GUI Refresh Does Nothing
**Location:** `order_flow_panel.py:374-378`
```python
def refresh_display(self):
    """Refresh display (called by timer)"""
    # This would be called by timer to refresh data
    # In production, would fetch latest metrics from backend
    pass  # ❌ EMPTY IMPLEMENTATION
```
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical - GUI shows static data only

---

### Finding #3: Volume Data Not Streamed
**Location:** `ctrader_provider.py` - Missing volume parsing
**Impact:**
- Volume imbalance cannot be calculated
- Buy/sell pressure metrics unavailable
- Large order detection incomplete

**Severity:** 🟡 High - Reduces signal quality

---

### Finding #4: No WebSocket Connection
**Location:** `ctrader_provider.py:148-152`
```python
def _connect_twisted(self) -> None:
    # For now, placeholder - will implement full Twisted→asyncio bridge
    pass  # ❌ NO CONNECTION LOGIC
```
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical - System cannot connect to cTrader

---

## 💡 Recommended Solution: Quick Fix

### Strategy: Polling-Based Bridge (4-6 hours)

Instead of implementing complex Twisted integration, use **polling** as immediate solution:

1. **Create OrderBookPoller service** (1 hour)
   - Poll `get_market_depth()` every 5 seconds
   - Write to `market_depth` table
   - Already have database schema

2. **Connect DOMAggregator → GUI** (2 hours)
   - Implement `refresh_display()` in OrderFlowPanel
   - Query latest metrics from DOMAggregatorService
   - Update GUI every 2 seconds

3. **Add volume estimation** (1 hour)
   - Get volume from aggregated bars
   - Estimate buy/sell split from bar direction
   - Display in GUI

4. **Testing & debugging** (1 hour)

**Result:** Fully functional order flow display with 5-second latency

## 📈 Migration Path

### Short-term (Week 1)
- ✅ Implement polling-based order book
- ✅ Connect GUI to data
- ✅ Basic volume display
- **Outcome:** System operational with 5s delay

### Medium-term (Week 2-3)

## ✅ Conclusion

**Current State:**
The order flow analysis system is 60% complete. All backend logic and GUI components are fully implemented, but the critical data pipeline (WebSocket → Database → GUI) is missing.

**Blockers:**
4 critical placeholders prevent real-time order flow data from reaching the GUI.

**Solution:**
A 4-6 hour polling-based quick fix provides immediate functionality, with clear path to full WebSocket integration later.

**Recommendation:**
✅ Implement Phase 1 (polling) immediately
✅ Test with demo account
✅ Upgrade to WebSocket in Phase 3

**Expected Outcome:**
Fully functional order flow trading system with professional-grade analytics, alerts, and visualizations.
