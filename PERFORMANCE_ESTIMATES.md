## 2. WIN RATE TRADING

### Fattori che Influenzano Win Rate

**Accuracy vs Win Rate Gap**:
```python
# Win Rate ≠ Prediction Accuracy

Factors creating gap:
1. Risk Management
   - Stop loss triggered prima del target
   - Trailing stop locks profits early
   - Time stops force exits

2. Execution Costs
   - Spread crossing reduces edge
   - Slippage in volatile conditions
   - Commission erodes small wins

3. Position Management
   - Partial exits reduce winners
   - Scale-in/out affects statistics
   - Break-even stops create more losses

Expected Gap: -3% to -8%
```

#### Multi-Level Stop Loss Impact

```python
6 Stop Types (Priority Order):

1. DAILY_LOSS (3%)
   - Kills all positions → Rare but impacts win rate
   - Estimated impact: -0.5% win rate

2. CORRELATION_STOP
   - Systemic risk exit → Can save from bigger losses
   - Estimated impact: -1.0% win rate (but better P&L)

3. TIME_STOP (24h max)
   - Forces exit on stagnant trades
   - Estimated impact: -2.0% win rate

4. VOLATILITY_STOP (2×ATR)
   - Wider than typical retail stops
   - Estimated impact: -1.5% win rate

5. TECHNICAL_STOP
   - Pattern invalidation
   - Estimated impact: -1.0% win rate

6. TRAILING_STOP
   - Locks profits but can exit early on pullbacks
   - Estimated impact: -2.0% win rate (but increases profit factor)

Total Stop Loss Impact: -6% to -8% win rate
BUT: Significantly improves profit factor and max drawdown
```

#### Smart Execution Impact

```python
Time-of-Day Optimization:
- Avoid wide spreads (Asian session)
- Execute in high liquidity (London-NY overlap)
- TWAP for large orders

Impact: +1-2% win rate (better fills, less slippage)
```

#### Regime-Aware Position Sizing Impact

```python
Trade Selection:
- Higher confidence in trending regimes
- Smaller positions in volatile/ranging
- Skip low-confidence signals (< 60%)

Signal filtering impact: +2-3% win rate
(Trade less, but better quality trades)
```

### WIN RATE CALCULATION

```
Starting point: Prediction Accuracy = 62-66%

Adjustments:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Base Accuracy:                    62-66%
- Multi-level stops:              -6 to -8%
- Execution costs drag:           -1 to -2%
+ Smart execution:                +1 to +2%
+ Signal filtering (conf > 60%):  +2 to +3%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
NET WIN RATE:                     58-61%
```

║  Optimistic:   61-64%                                  ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

By Market Regime:
- Trending Up:      65-70% win rate
- Trending Down:    62-67% win rate
- Ranging:          48-52% win rate
- Volatile:         45-50% win rate

Overall (weighted): 58-61%
```

**Why Win Rate < Accuracy?**
- Stops trigger before profit targets
- Trailing stops lock early profits
- Time stops force exits
- Transaction costs erode edge
- BUT: Better profit factor and lower max drawdown

## 3. SHARPE RATIO

### Components of Sharpe Ratio

```python
Sharpe Ratio = (Mean Return - Risk Free Rate) / Std Dev of Returns × √252

Factors:
1. Mean Return per trade
2. Volatility of returns (std dev)
3. Trade frequency
4. Consistency across regimes
```

### Return Estimation

#### Average Win/Loss Calculation

```python
Risk/Reward Setup:
- Initial Stop: 2% from entry (ATR-based, typically 20-40 pips EURUSD)
- Take Profit: 2:1 ratio = 4% from entry (40-80 pips)

With Multi-Level Stops:
- Some exits earlier (trailing stop)
- Some exits later (trend continuation)
- Some stopped at break-even

Realistic Distribution:
Average Win:  +1.8% to +2.2% (R = 1.8-2.2)
Average Loss: -1.2% to -1.5% (R = 1.2-1.5)

Why losses smaller than 2%?
- Trailing stops reduce losses
- Correlation stops prevent big losses
- Volatility stops adaptive
```

#### Expectancy Calculation

```python
Win Rate = 59% (realistic estimate)
Avg Win = +2.0%
Avg Loss = -1.35%

Expectancy = (Win Rate × Avg Win) + ((1 - Win Rate) × Avg Loss)
           = (0.59 × 2.0%) + (0.41 × -1.35%)
           = 1.18% - 0.554%
           = 0.626% per trade

With Transaction Costs:
- Spread: 0.02% (2 pips EURUSD)
- Commission: 0.01%
- Slippage: 0.01%
Total Cost: 0.04% per trade

Net Expectancy = 0.626% - 0.04% = 0.586% per trade
```

#### Trade Frequency

```python
Signal Generation:
- Check every 60 seconds (default)
- Min signal confidence: 60%
- Consensus requirement: 60%
- Max positions: 3-5

Conservative Estimate:
- Signals per day: 3-5 (high quality only)
- Positions per day: 1-2 (after filtering)
- Avg holding time: 8-12 hours

Annual Trades:
- Trading days: 250
- Trades per year: 250-400 (realistic: ~300)
```

#### Annual Return Estimation

```python
Conservative Scenario:
- Trades per year: 250
- Net expectancy: 0.50% per trade
- Compounding: No (conservative)

Annual Return = 250 × 0.50% = 125%
ROI = 125% (too high, not realistic with proper risk management)

With Position Sizing (1% risk per trade):
- Max capital at risk: 1% per trade
- Max positions: 3
- Max concurrent risk: 3%

Realistic Annual Return:
- Base expectancy: 0.586% per trade
- Position size: 1% risk (not full capital)
- Trades: 300/year
- Return: 300 × 0.586% × (avg position size / capital)

Assuming avg position = 10% of capital:
Annual Return = 300 × 0.586% × 0.10 = 17.6%

More realistic (accounting for drawdowns, regime changes):
Annual Return = 12-18%
```

### Volatility Estimation

```python
Daily Return Volatility:
- Forex intraday: ~0.5% to 1.5% daily price movement
- With leverage (2:1): ~1% to 3% portfolio volatility
- With position sizing: ~0.3% to 0.8% daily volatility

Standard Deviation of Returns:
- Per trade: 1.2% to 1.8%
- Daily (1-2 trades): 1.5% to 2.5%
- Monthly: 5% to 8%
- Annual: 18% to 25%
```

### Sharpe Ratio Calculation

```python
Scenario 1: Conservative
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Annual Return: 12%
Risk-Free Rate: 4% (2024 rates)
Std Dev: 22%

Sharpe = (12% - 4%) / 22% = 0.36
(Too low, below 1.0)

Scenario 2: Realistic
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Annual Return: 18%
Risk-Free Rate: 4%
Std Dev: 18%

Sharpe = (18% - 4%) / 18% = 0.78
(Still below 1.0, but acceptable for retail)

Scenario 3: With Optimization
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Annual Return: 24%
Risk-Free Rate: 4%
Std Dev: 16% (better risk management)

Sharpe = (24% - 4%) / 16% = 1.25
(Good, above 1.0)

Scenario 4: Best Case
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Annual Return: 30%
Risk-Free Rate: 4%
Std Dev: 15% (optimal regime filtering)

Sharpe = (30% - 4%) / 15% = 1.73
(Excellent for retail trading)
```

## 4. OTHER IMPORTANT METRICS

### Sortino Ratio
```
Expected: 1.4 - 2.0
(Higher than Sharpe because multi-level stops reduce downside)

Calculation:
Sortino = (Return - RFR) / Downside Deviation
        = (20% - 4%) / 8%
        = 2.0
```

### Calmar Ratio
```
Expected: 1.2 - 1.8

Max Drawdown Estimate: 10-15%
Annual Return: 15-25%

Calmar = Annual Return / Max Drawdown
       = 20% / 12%
       = 1.67

## DISCLAIMER

```
⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:

1. PAST PERFORMANCE ≠ FUTURE RESULTS
   These estimates are based on historical data analysis and assumptions.
   Actual performance may vary significantly.

2. RISK WARNING
   Forex trading involves substantial risk. You can lose more than your
   initial investment. Only trade with capital you can afford to lose.

3. NO GUARANTEE
   These estimates are NOT guarantees. Market conditions change.
   Models can degrade. Execution can fail.

4. VALIDATION REQUIRED
   ALWAYS validate with paper trading and small capital before
   full deployment.

5. PROFESSIONAL ADVICE
   Consider consulting with a licensed financial advisor before
   trading with real money.

6. REGULAR MONITORING
   Continuous monitoring and periodic retraining are ESSENTIAL.
   Do not "set and forget."

7. DRAWDOWNS WILL HAPPEN
   Expect drawdowns. Have a plan. Don't panic during normal variance.

8. MARKET CONDITIONS MATTER
   Performance will vary based on market regime. Some periods will
   underperform, others will overperform.
