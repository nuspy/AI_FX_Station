      "tooltip": "Chart Timeframe Selector\n\n1) WHAT IT IS:\nSelect the time period represented by each candlestick on the chart.\n1m = 1-minute candles, 1d = daily candles, etc.\n\nEach timeframe represents a different granularity of price action:\n- Higher timeframes (4h, 1d) = bigger picture, less noise\n- Lower timeframes (1m, 5m) = detailed view, more noise\n\n2) HOW AND WHEN TO USE:\n\nWhen to use different timeframes:\n- Scalping: 1m, 5m (trades lasting 5-60 minutes)\n- Day trading: 15m, 30m, 1h (trades within the same day)\n- Swing trading: 4h, 1d (trades lasting days to weeks)\n- Position trading: 1d, 1w (trades lasting weeks to months)\n\nHow to use (Multi-timeframe analysis):\n1. Start with higher timeframe (1d) to identify major trend\n2. Drop to medium timeframe (1h) to find entry zones\n3. Use lower timeframe (15m) for precise entry timing\n\nRelevance by strategy:\n- Scalping: CRITICAL - must use 1m/5m for entries\n- Day trading: IMPORTANT - 15m/1h is your decision timeframe\n- Swing trading: MODERATE - 4h/1d for entries, lower TF for precision\n- Position trading: LOW - 1d/1w sufficient, lower TF unnecessary\n\n3) WHY TO USE IT:\n- See the same market at different time scales\n- Align your strategy with appropriate granularity\n- Avoid trading against the higher timeframe trend (e.g., don't short on 15m if 1d is strong uptrend)\n- Multi-timeframe confluence increases probability of success\n- Match timeframe to your trading style and available time\n\n4) EFFECTS:\n\n4.1) LOW TIMEFRAMES (1m, 5m):\n\nBehavior:\n- Each candle forms very quickly (1-5 minutes)\n- Extremely detailed price action visible\n- Every small move captured\n- High frequency of signals\n\nAdvantages:\n- Maximum precision for scalping entries\n- Catch micro-patterns and quick reversals\n- Perfect for intraday momentum trading\n- See exact price levels where orders execute\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Very HIGH NOISE - many false signals\n- Requires constant monitoring (can't step away)\n- Spread costs significant on small moves\n- Whipsaws and stop hunts common\n- Stressful and time-consuming\n\nWhen to use:\n- Scalping strategies (5-15 minute holds)\n- Precise entry timing within larger setup\n- Day trading during high volatility sessions\n- When you can actively monitor for hours\n\n4.2) MEDIUM TIMEFRAMES (15m, 30m, 1h):\n\nBehavior:\n- Balanced view of price action\n- Filters out most micro-noise\n- Patterns form over hours\n- Moderate frequency of signals\n\nAdvantages:\n- OPTIMAL balance noise vs signal\n- Reliable patterns (3+ candles = hours of confirmation)\n- Good for part-time traders (check every hour)\n- Widely followed by institutions (support/resistance respected)\n- Lifestyle-friendly (not glued to screen)\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Slower reaction to news events (compared to 1m/5m)\n- Larger stop losses needed (more pips)\n- Fewer opportunities (1-2 setups per day vs 10+ on 1m)\n- May miss very fast intraday moves\n\nWhen to use:\n- Day trading (trades lasting 1-8 hours)\n- Short-term swing trading (overnight to 3 days)\n- PRIMARY timeframe for most retail traders\n- When checking chart 1-3 times per hour is feasible\n\n4.3) HIGH TIMEFRAMES (4h, 1d, 1w):\n\nBehavior:\n- Big picture view of market\n- Very smooth trends, minimal noise\n- Patterns develop over days/weeks\n- Low frequency of signals\n\nAdvantages:\n- MAXIMUM RELIABILITY - patterns proven over days\n- Major levels highly respected by institutions\n- Check ONCE per day (or even weekly)\n- Perfect for busy people with day jobs\n- Low stress, no need for constant monitoring\n\nDisadvantages:\n- VERY SLOW to react (4 hours per candle on 4h chart!)\n- Wide stop losses required (50-200 pips)\n- Very few opportunities (1-2 setups per month)\n- Requires large account (wide stops = more capital)\n- Boring for active traders\n\nWhen to use:\n- Swing trading (holds lasting 3-30 days)\n- Position trading (weeks to months)\n- Trend identification for lower timeframe entries\n- When you can only check markets once per day\n- When you want lifestyle freedom\n\n5) TYPICAL RANGE / DEFAULT VALUES:\n\n- Minimum: 1m (highest granularity available)\n- BEGINNER DEFAULT: 1h (best balance for learning)\n- SCALPER DEFAULT: 5m (detailed but not too noisy)\n- DAY TRADER DEFAULT: 15m or 1h\n- SWING TRADER DEFAULT: 4h or 1d\n- POSITION TRADER DEFAULT: 1d or 1w\n- Maximum: 1M (monthly, rarely used)\n\nUsage distribution:\n- Beginners: 80% should start with 1h timeframe\n- Intermediate: 40% use 15m-1h, 40% use 4h-1d, 20% use 1m-5m\n- Advanced: Spread across all timeframes based on strategy\n\nRecommendation by experience:\n- Beginner: Start with 1h ONLY for first 6 months (master one timeframe)\n- Intermediate: Add 4h (trend filter) and 15m (entry timing)\n- Advanced: Full multi-timeframe analysis (1d → 4h → 1h → 15m)\n\n6) ADDITIONAL NOTES / BEST PRACTICES:\n\nMulti-timeframe workflow (THE RIGHT WAY):\n1. Start on Daily (1d): What's the major trend? Up, down, or range?\n2. Drop to 4H: Confirm trend, identify swing structure\n3. Drop to 1H: Find entry setups aligned with 4H/Daily trend\n4. Drop to 15m: Precise entry point (breakout, pullback, etc.)\n\nCommon mistakes to AVOID:\n- Trading lower TF against higher TF trend (fighting the trend = lose)\n- Using only 1 timeframe (missing big picture)\n- Too many timeframes (analysis paralysis, conflicting signals)\n- Switching timeframes randomly (lack of consistency)\n\nOptimal timeframe combinations:\n- Scalping: 5m (primary) + 15m (trend filter)\n- Day trading: 15m (primary) + 1h (trend) + 5m (entry)\n- Swing trading: 4h (primary) + 1d (trend) + 1h (entry)\n- Position: 1d (primary) + 1w (trend) + 4h (entry)\n\nHow ForexGPT uses timeframes:\n- Indicators calculated on ALL timeframes simultaneously\n- Multi-timeframe ensemble model combines predictions from 6 timeframes\n- Regime detection uses 4h and 1d for macro trend\n- Signals generated on 1h, refined on 15m for entry\n\nKeyboard shortcuts:\n- Ctrl+Up: Next higher timeframe\n- Ctrl+Down: Next lower timeframe\n- Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+9: Jump to specific timeframes"

PRACTICES:\n\nThe accuracy-visibility trade-off:\n- Shorter horizon = higher accuracy, less visibility\n- Longer horizon = lower accuracy, more visibility\n- Sweet spot: horizon where accuracy still >55% but gives enough time to act\n- For most: horizon 4-6 bars optimal\n\nCalculating real-world time:\n- Real time = horizon × timeframe_minutes\n- Example: horizon 4 on 15m TF = 4 × 15 = 60 minutes (1 hour)\n- Example: horizon 12 on 1h TF = 12 × 1 = 12 hours\n\nMatching horizon to execution:\n- If you need 5 minutes to analyze and enter: horizon ≥ 1 (on 5m TF)\n- If you need 1 hour to analyze: horizon ≥ 4 (on 15m TF)\n- If you check markets once per day: horizon ≥ 24 (on 1h TF)\n\nMulti-horizon ensemble (ADVANCED):\n- Train 3 models: horizon 1, 4, 12\n- Combine predictions (weighted average or voting)\n- Horizon 1: 50% weight (accuracy)\n- Horizon 4: 30% weight (balance)\n- Horizon 12: 20% weight (trend confirmation)\n- Result: Best of all worlds (accuracy + visibility)\n\nInteraction with other parameters:\n- Longer horizon + more features = better (captures complex patterns)\n- Longer horizon + more days = CRITICAL (need enough data to learn long-term patterns)\n- Horizon 24 with only 7 days data = DISASTER (not enough examples of 24-bar sequences)\n- Rule: days × (1440/TF) / horizon ≥ 200 examples minimum\n  Example: horizon 12, 1h TF → need 12 × 200 / 24 = 100 days minimum\n\nStop loss sizing:\n- Horizon 1: tight stops (5-10 pips)\n- Horizon 4: medium stops (10-20 pips)\n- Horizon 12: wide stops (20-40 pips)\n- Horizon 24: very wide stops (40-80 pips)\n- Longer horizon needs room for noise between now and target\n\nHow ForexGPT uses horizon:\n- Target variable: y = close[t+horizon] - close[t] (price change)\n- Or: y = sign(close[t+horizon] - close[t]) (direction)\n- Model learns: f(features[t]) → prediction[t+horizon]\n- At inference: Given current features, predict horizon bars ahead\n- Trading engine: Uses prediction to decide entry NOW for exit in horizon bars"
